Hi  Team,

We are working on automating GCP project creation through the Cloudhub Swagger APIs, and we have a couple of queries along with one issue where we need your assistance:

GCP Project Creation Request (Dev APIs):
Does submitting a GCP project creation request to the Cloudhub Dev APIs actually trigger backend workflows to provision the project/resources, or does it simply accept the request as a mock API without performing backend actions?

Team DL Input (UI Issue):
While submitting the request manually from the UI (2nd page – Team DL input), our team DLs are not being accepted. We tried with both @company.com and @mycompany.com formats. Please find the attached screenshot for reference.

Response Body Fields (batid and catid):
Could you clarify what batid and catid represent in the response body? We couldn’t find corresponding inputs for these fields in the manual UI process.

Thanks in advance for your support. Looking forward to your guidance.
