14. Automated Incident Ticketing	cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannels	"• Formalize Model Incident Response: Ensure every model performance alert is tracked as a formal incident in Jira or ServiceNow. 
• Auto-Populate Tickets: Fill incident tickets with key model information like the endpoint ID, model version, and links to performance dashboards."	Medium	
15. Capacity Forecasting with ML	cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest	"• Forecast Prediction Traffic: Use historical QPS data to predict future traffic patterns and proactively scale Vertex AI endpoints.
