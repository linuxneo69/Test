Clarification on Functional ID (FID) Onboarding Process for Dev Environment

Hi AD Team,

I am reaching out regarding the Functional ID (FID) onboarding process for the development environment.

Previously, we had raised a request to onboard an FID to sky in order to:

Authenticate Swagger UI endpoints using the FID token

Generate Vault credentials (Vault Token, Vault ID, and Vault Secret)

However, our request was rejected, and it was confirmed that the FID onboarding process for Dev/UAT environments has been deprecated.

As we are planning to use an FID for our application workflows, we would like to check:

Is there an alternative process available to onboard an FID for the development environment?

Are there any workarounds or updated guidelines to enable FID integration with sky for Dev/UAT?

If onboarding is no longer supported, what would be the recommended approach for applications requiring FID-based authentication in Dev?

Your guidance on the current process or available alternatives would be greatly appreciated, as this is a critical dependency for our development and testing activities.

Thanks in advance for your support.
